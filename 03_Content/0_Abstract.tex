\section*{Abstract}
Efficient stencil computation is essential to fields as material science, climate modeling or aero dynamics. New hardware accelerators, like the Cerebras wafer scale engine (WSE), offer a new programming paradigm that allows more efficient stencil computation compared to traditional approaches using CPUs or GPUs.
