\chapter{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item More optimization: use border PEs in a smarter way, use explicit dsr assignment,try to overlap communication and computation in the general algorithm, try achieving full simd width
    \item JOR, Gauss-Seidel / Red-Black implentation and SOR method or multigrid methods
    \item automatic convergence detection
\end{itemize}
