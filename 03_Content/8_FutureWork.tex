\chapter{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \item More optimization: use border \acp{pe} in a smarter way, use explicit \ac{dsr} assignment,try to overlap communication and computation in the general algorithm
    \item try achieving full simd width (lower precision data types??)
    \item JOR, Gauss-Seidel / Red-Black implentation and SOR method or multigrid methods
    \item automatic convergence detection
\end{itemize} 


variable coefficients accross the grid. while not implemented in this work, should be easy and without performance overhead.

asymetric coefficients. Not that hard to extend to. should have no performance overhead for tiled implementation except r1 optimized implementation that uses pv1+pv2+pv3+pv4=p(v1+v2+v3+v4) as optimization strategy, which is not applicable for asymetric coefficients.

non-linear stencils would invole more work to implement and potentially optimize.

extend to box shaped stencils,
